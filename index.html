        <p>Presently, I am working in sub-contracting department. I have assigned to develop an online application for tracking the material movement to vendors and products from vendors and processing their bills. Its development is going on.Front end is php and back end is mysql.

             But I want to learn more web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS, Node JS and MongoDB to make the web application more effective and user friendly.
